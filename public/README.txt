INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING NEW CHEATSHEETS
=========================================

To add a new candidate's cheatsheet:

1. Create a JSON file with the candidate's name (e.g., gokul-yadav.json)
2. Upload it to the 'public' folder in this repository
3. The cheatsheet will be accessible at: your-domain.com/gokul-yadav

JSON files in the 'public' folder are served from the root URL.

Example: public/gokul-yadav.json → accessible at /gokul-yadav.json
